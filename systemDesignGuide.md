# System Design Interview Template

The system design interview is an open-ended conversation where you are expected to lead the discussion. Below is a structured template to help guide your approach and ensure you address all critical aspects effectively.

---

## Step 1: Outline Use Cases, Constraints, and Assumptions

### 1.1 Understand the Problem
- **Clarify Requirements:**
  - Who are the users of the system?
  - What are the main use cases?
  - What problem are we solving?
- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - What inputs does the system need to process?
  - What outputs are expected?

### 1.2 Gather Metrics
- **Users:**
  - How many users are expected initially?
  - How might the user base grow over time?
- **Traffic and Performance:**
  - How many requests per second (RPS) are expected?
  - What is the read-to-write ratio?
- **Data Volume:**
  - How much data will the system handle (e.g., daily, monthly)?
  - What is the expected rate of data growth?

### 1.3 Define Constraints
- **Non-functional Requirements:**
  - Latency requirements (e.g., response time should be under 100ms).
  - Availability and reliability targets (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
- **Technology Constraints:**
  - Specific technology stack preferences or restrictions.

### 1.4 Make Assumptions
- Clearly state assumptions to fill in any gaps in the problem statement. For example:
  - Assume users are geographically distributed.
  - Assume a high network latency in certain regions.

## Step 2: Create a High-Level Design

### 2.1 Identify Key Components
- Client-side applications (e.g., web, mobile).
- API gateway or backend services.
- Databases and storage layers (SQL/NoSQL).
- Caching systems (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Load balancers.
- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).
- Messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Blob storage.

### 2.2 Sketch the Architecture
- Use diagrams to visualize the components and their interactions.
- Highlight:
  - Data flow between components.
  - Communication protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC).

### 2.3 Justify the Design
- Explain why you chose specific components and technologies.
  - Example: "Using a relational database for strong consistency and complex queries."

---

## Step 3: Design Core Components

### 3.1 Dive into Specifics
- Break down each component into:
  - Functionality.
  - Key operations.
- Example: For a URL shortening service:
  - **Hash Generation:** Use Base62 to encode hashes. Address collisions with retries.
  - **Storage:** Use NoSQL for high write throughput.

### 3.2 Define APIs
- Specify the key APIs:
  - Inputs, outputs, and endpoints.
  - Example for a URL shortening service:
    - **POST /shorten:** Accepts a full URL and returns a short URL.
    - **GET /:shortUrl:** Returns the original URL for the short URL.

### 3.3 Database Design
- Choose the database type:
  - SQL for transactional consistency.
  - NoSQL for scalability and performance.
- Define the schema:
  - Tables, indexes, and relationships.

---

## Step 4: Scale the Design

### 4.1 Identify Bottlenecks
- Discuss potential challenges:
  - Single points of failure.
  - Performance under high load.

### 4.2 Introduce Scaling Solutions
- **Load Balancers:** Distribute traffic across servers.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more servers for scalability.
- **Caching:**
  - Use in-memory caches (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load.
  - Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, popular URLs).
- **Database Scaling:**
  - Sharding for large datasets.
  - Replication for read-heavy workloads.

### 4.3 Trade-Off Analysis
- Every decision involves trade-offs. Discuss:
  - **Consistency vs. Availability:** How does your system handle partitioning?
  - **Performance vs. Scalability:** Justify any expensive components.

---

## Step 5: Discuss Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Scalability
- Strategies for scaling up (vertical) or out (horizontal).

### 5.2 Reliability
- Fault tolerance, replication, retries.

### 5.3 Latency
- Optimal caching, database optimizations, CDN use.

### 5.4 Security
- Encryption (at-rest and in-transit), authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT).

### 5.5 Monitoring
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana for metrics.
- Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin.

---

## Step 6: Conclude with Enhancements

### 6.1 Summarize the Design
- Recap the systemâ€™s core functionality and architecture.
- Highlight how the design meets the requirements and constraints.

### 6.2 Propose Future Improvements
- **Scaling:**
  - Sharding databases, adding regions to CDNs.
  - Implementing circuit breakers, retries.
- **Performance:**
  - Fine-tuning indexes, optimizing load balancers.
- **Observability:**
  - Improve logging, monitoring systems.

## Additional Tips and Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

### Traffic Estimation:
- E.g., For 10M monthly active users and 10 actions/user/day:
  - 10M x 10 = 100M actions/month.
  - ~38 actions/second on average.

### Storage Estimation:
- E.g., If each action generates 1KB of data:
  - 100M x 1KB = 100GB/month.

## Classic System Design Examples

### TinyURL:
- **Requirements:** Shorten URLs, redirect efficiently.
- **Components:** Hashing for unique IDs, NoSQL for storing mappings.

### WhatsApp:
- **Requirements:** Real-time messaging, end-to-end encryption.
- **Components:** WebSockets for real-time, distributed messaging queue.

### Twitter:
- **Requirements:** Post tweets, timeline ranking.
- **Components:** Pub-Sub system for notifications, distributed database for tweets.

### Uber:
- **Requirements:** Match riders to drivers, real-time tracking.
- **Components:** Geospatial database, distributed task scheduler.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Writing code: Focus on architecture, not implementation.
- Building without a plan: Start with requirements and high-level design.
- Working in silence: Talk through your reasoning.
- Ignoring trade-offs: Acknowledge weaknesses and constraints.
