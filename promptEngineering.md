# **Guide to Effective Prompt Engineering**

## **🔹 Key Strategies for Improving Prompts**

### **1️⃣ Providing Clear and Precise Instructions**
To get high-quality responses, use the following strategies:
✔ **Detailed Prompting** – Provide comprehensive and clear instructions.  
✔ **Role Prompting** – Ask the model to act in a specific role (e.g., "You are a financial analyst...").  
✔ **Providing Examples** – Show examples of the desired output.  
✔ **Defining Response Length** – Specify whether the response should be short, medium, or detailed.  
✔ **Reinforcing Key Instructions at the End** – Helps prevent errors from the model.  
✔ **Using Delimiters** – Mark different sections in the prompt (e.g., with `###`).  
✔ **Handling Special Cases** – Define how to deal with missing information or contradictions.  
✔ **Requesting Structured Output** – Ask the model to return JSON, tables, or structured lists.

### **2️⃣ Allow the Model "Time to Think"**
To improve response quality, use techniques such as:

🧩 **Chain of Thought** – Ask the model to explain its reasoning step by step.  
📝 **Explicit Prompting** – "Answer in a step-by-step manner."  
🔄 **Few-Shot Learning** – Provide multiple examples before asking the question.  

---

### **3️⃣ Systematic Prompt Development (Iterative Prompting)**
✅ **Initial Testing** – Try different prompts on various examples.  
✅ **Analyze Results** – Identify what worked well and what didn’t.  
✅ **Refine Instructions** – Add clarifications and improve structure.  
✅ **Repeat the Process** – Iteratively improve until achieving optimal results.

## **🎯 Example of an Advanced Prompt**
```python
import json
from anthropic import Anthropic

def analyze_business_insights(news_text, model_results):
    """
    Extract business insights from news articles using Claude.
    
    Args:
        news_text (str): The text content of the news article
        model_results (dict): Preliminary model analysis results
        
    Returns:
        dict: Claude's analysis of business insights
    """
    # Initialize the Anthropic client
    client = Anthropic()
    
    # Construct the AI prompt
    prompt = f"""
## Business Insights Analysis from News Article
### News Article
{news_text}
### Preliminary Model Analysis
{json.dumps(model_results, indent=2)}
### Your Task
Please extract significant business insights from this news article. Address the following five categories:
1. **Potential stock market impacts**
2. **Competitive implications**
3. **Business opportunities**
4. **Potential risks**
5. **Relevant market trends**
---
## 📌 Guidelines for Response:
- **Each key must contain at least 3-5 relevant insights**.
- **Each insight should include a brief explanation (1-3 sentences)**.
- **Total response length: 400-600 words**.
- **Clearly distinguish between short-term and long-term effects**.
- **Indicate the level of certainty** (`low/medium/high`).
- **If global implications are relevant, include them**.
- **Strictly avoid political interpretations – focus only on business aspects**.
---
## 📌 Special Cases:
- If **insufficient information** exists, return `{{ "insufficient_data": true }}`.
- If there are **contradictory insights**, explain both and estimate likelihood.
- If the article discusses a **financial crisis**, include `"crisis_response_strategy"` key.
- If it's about a **specific company**, provide `"company_specific_analysis"` with in-depth insights.
---
## 📌 Important Guidelines:
✅ Base insights **only** on the article and model analysis.  
✅ **Distinguish short-term vs. long-term effects**.  
✅ Indicate **certainty level (low/medium/high)**.  
✅ Consider **global implications**.  
✅ **Avoid political bias** – focus on business aspects.
### Example of Desired Response
```json
{{
  "market_impact": [
    {{
      "impact": "Expected 3-5% decline in sector company stocks",
      "reasoning": "The regulatory change announcement creates uncertainty",
      "timeframe": "Short-term (1-3 months)",
      "confidence": "High"
    }},
    {{
      "impact": "Possible recovery in the medium term",
      "reasoning": "Companies will adapt to new requirements",
      "timeframe": "Medium (6-12 months)",
      "confidence": "Medium"
    }}
  ],
  "competitive_implications": [
    "Advantage for larger players with resources for quick adaptation",
    "Higher entry barriers for new players",
    "Opportunity for technology companies to provide compliance solutions"
