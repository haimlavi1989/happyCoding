# Enhanced Prompt Tips

Strategy 1: Clear and Specific Instructions:
The following prompt was created using these 8 key prompting strategies:
1. **Detailed prompt** - Providing comprehensive instructions
2. **Role prompting** - Defining a specific role for the AI
3. **Providing examples** - Including concrete examples of desired output
4. **Specifying prompt length** - Defining the expected response length
5. **Repeating important instructions at the end** - Reinforcing key points
6. **Delimiters** - Using clear section markers
7. **Special case instructions** - Handling exceptions and edge cases
8. **Asking for structured output** - Requesting specific output format

Strategy 2: Give the model "time to think"
These strategies focus on improving the quality of AI model responses by encouraging organized and gradual thinking processes.

Chain of Thought

The concept of "Chain of Thought" is to break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and cause LLM models to present a sequence of intermediate steps that lead to the desired answer.
Help the model by asking to detail the steps to complete a task: Step 1: ..., Step 2: ...
Ask the model to explain each step
Even just mentioning this instruction can improve results!
"Take a step-by-step approach in your answer"

Strategy 3: Test changes systematically

Performance improvement is easier when it can be measured
Sometimes, a change in the prompt may achieve better performance in some isolated examples, but lead to worse performance across a representative set of examples
Prompt engineering should be data-driven and tested on a large scale
Developing effective prompts requires an experimental approach

Iterative prompt development

Try something with a small group of examples
Analyze where the results don't give what you want
Clarify the instructions
And repeat the process again...
Circular process: Idea → Implementation (code/data/prompt) → Experimental result → Error analysis → New idea

Types of models affect response quality

GPT-3.5 → Fast and cost-efficient, but weaker in complex thinking
GPT-4 → Stronger, supports images, but slower and more expensive
GPT-4o → Optimized for speed and multimodal interactions
o1 → The best for deep thinking and specialized problem solving

## Business Insights Analysis from News Article

### News Article
{news_text}

### Preliminary Model Analysis
{json.dumps(model_results, indent=2)}

### Your Task
Please extract significant business insights from this news article. Address the following 5 categories:
1. Potential stock market impacts
2. Competitive implications
3. Business opportunities
4. Potential risks
5. Relevant market trends

### Example of Desired Response
```json
{{
  "market_impact": [
    {{
      "impact": "Expected 3-5% decline in sector company stocks",
      "reasoning": "The regulatory change announcement creates uncertainty",
      "timeframe": "Short-term (1-3 months)",
      "confidence": "High"
    }},
    {{
      "impact": "Possible recovery in the medium term",
      "reasoning": "Companies will adapt to new requirements",
      "timeframe": "Medium (6-12 months)",
      "confidence": "Medium"
    }}
  ],
  "competitive_implications": [
    "Advantage for larger players with resources for quick adaptation",
    "Higher entry barriers for new players",
    "Opportunity for technology companies to provide compliance solutions"
  ]
}}
```

### Response Format Guidelines
Present your insights in JSON format with the following keys:
"market_impact", "competitive_implications", "business_opportunities", "potential_risks", "market_trends"

Each key should contain an array of relevant insights (at least 3-5 in each category).

### Response Scope
- The complete response should be 400-600 words in length
- For each category, provide at least 3 meaningful insights, but no more than 5
- For each insight, include 1-3 explanatory sentences

### Special Cases
- If the news doesn't contain sufficient information in a certain category, indicate this with the field "insufficient_data": true
- If there are contradictions in the information, note the alternative narratives and assess the likelihood of each
- If the news refers to a financial crisis, add an additional key named "crisis_response_strategy" with recommendations
- If the news is related to a specific company, add a "company_specific_analysis" key with in-depth analysis

### Important Guidelines to Remember
- Base your analysis only on facts presented in the news article and preliminary analysis
- Distinguish between short-term and long-term effects
- Indicate level of certainty (low/medium/high) for each insight
- Address global implications if relevant
- Avoid political interpretation and focus only on business aspects
